## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Permission Fixes Applied
- SystemD operations: `sudo systemctl`, `sudo journalctl`, `sudo systemd-analyze`
- Caddy operations: `sudo systemctl reload caddy`
- Service management: All systemctl commands use sudo
- File operations: Proper handling of permission-required directories

### API Endpoints Implemented
```
System Management:
  GET  /api/pockestrator/system/info
  GET  /api/pockestrator/system/health

Service Management:
  POST   /api/pockestrator/services
  GET    /api/pockestrator/services
  GET    /api/pockestrator/services/{id}
  DELETE /api/pockestrator/services/{id}
  POST   /api/pockestrator/services/{id}/control
  GET    /api/pockestrator/services/{id}/status
  GET    /api/pockestrator/services/{id}/logs

Validation:
  POST /api/pockestrator/validate/service
  GET  /api/pockestrator/validate/system
```

### Dashboard Integration
- React dashboard built successfully from `./dashboard` directory
- Build output (`dashboard/dist`) embedded using Go's `embed` package
- Static file serving configured to serve embedded files
- Fallback to filesystem for development mode

## 🚀 Current Status

### ✅ Working Features
- [x] Go binary builds successfully
- [x] Server starts and serves embedded dashboard
- [x] System health endpoint returns proper validation results
- [x] Permission issues properly identified and reported
- [x] All systemd/caddy operations use sudo correctly
- [x] Comprehensive error handling and logging
- [x] API documentation complete with examples

### 🔄 Ready for Testing
- [x] Service creation flow (needs proper permissions on target system)
- [x] SystemD service management
- [x] Caddy configuration updates
- [x] Service monitoring and logging
- [x] Full orchestration pipeline

## 🎯 Next Steps for Production Deployment

### 1. System Preparation
```bash
# Set up sudo permissions
sudo visudo -f /etc/sudoers.d/pockestrator
# Add the required permissions as documented

# Ensure required tools are installed
sudo apt update
sudo apt install systemd caddy

# Create base directory
sudo mkdir -p /home/ubuntu
sudo chown $USER:$USER /home/ubuntu
```

### 2. Service Deployment
```bash
# Build and deploy Pockestrator
go build
sudo cp pockestrator /usr/local/bin/

# Create systemd service for Pockestrator itself
sudo systemctl enable pockestrator
sudo systemctl start pockestrator
```

### 3. UI Integration
- The embedded React dashboard is ready for use
- All API endpoints documented for integration
- WebSocket support can be added for real-time features
- Authentication integration with PocketBase admin users
